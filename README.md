# roman-string-to-decimal

A simple Roman nummeral to decimal converter.

Even though this program seems simple, it took me quite some time to come up with a solution, the reason behind this is because of the constraints imposed by the Roman Nummerals. The hardest part was not to actually convert each digit to a number, this can be easily achieved, but my goal with this project was to handle wrong input as much as possible. I tried to prevent returning a value when wrong combinations are provided, but sadly, at the end, I could not prevent every single bug. I might return to it later, but for now, I am satisfied.
